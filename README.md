# Mobile-Device-Usage-and-User-Behavior-
This dataset provides a comprehensive analysis of mobile device usage patterns and user behavior classification. It contains 700 samples of user data, including metrics such as app usage time, screen-on time, battery drain, and data consumption. Each entry is categorized into one of five user behavior classes, ranging from light to extreme usage, allowing for insightful analysis and modeling.

Features:
1. User ID: Unique identifier for each user.
2. Device Model: Model of the user's smartphone.
3 Operating System: The OS of the device (iOS or Android).
4. App Usage Time: Daily time spent on mobile applications, measured in minutes.
5. Screen On Time: Average hours per day the screen is active.
6. Battery Drain: Daily battery consumption in mAh.
7. Number of Apps Installed: Total apps available on the device.
8. Data Usage: Daily mobile data consumption in megabytes.
9. Age: Age of the user.
10. Gender: Gender of the user (Male or Female).
11. User Behavior Class: Classification of user behavior based on usage patterns (1 to 5).

This dataset is ideal for researchers, data scientists, and analysts interested in understanding mobile user behavior and developing predictive models in the realm of mobile technology and applications. This Dataset was primarily designed to implement machine learning algorithms and is not a reliable source for a paper or article.
